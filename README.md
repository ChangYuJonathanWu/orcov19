## About
COVID-19 has put immense strain on hospitals and supply chains. ORCoV-19 shows available hospital beds, ventilators and shipment data on critical supplies such as N95 and surgical masks.

## Update 11/11/2020

After half a year, I've decided to stop maintaining this dashboard. This is largely because of frequently changing data sources and formats which has made maintenance too time consuming and impractical. Please visit the [Oregon Health Authority](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/Pages/index.aspx) for the most up-to-date data.
